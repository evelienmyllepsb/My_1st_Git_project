# Git & GitHub Dictionary

- Git: a versioning system that keeps track of changes - allows you to go back, allows for collaboration, is locally stored.

- GitHub: Where we can acces other's files, online repository for your codes (not only) (Back up place for you rgit projects). "cloud based" located ... remote ...

IMPORTANT: Don't do doble `git init`

IMPORTANT: Don't remove the `.git` folder where your history is kept

# Conceptual Areas

1. Developing area: The workinng directory

2. Staging area: Temporary space to store file beffore commiting to the local repo.

3. Local repo: It is where the snapshots are saved
   
   - To access the history in the local repo so I can get informatino about who, when and what was modified I can use `log`. That will be useful when I want to travel in time.

## Git status allow me to check what files are

1. to be staged: You have commited tjhis file/folder before, you have made new changes and git recognise the new changes are not yet `add` not `commit`.

2. to be commited: You have commited file before, you have made new changes and git recognises you have `add` **but not** `commit`

3. Untracked: Is a completely new file/folder that **HAS NEVER** been `add` nor `commit`
